Door and drawer openings: a question of functionality and design



<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Designing bathroom furniture is a <strong>balance between aesthetics and functionality</strong>: every detail, including the <strong>opening system</strong> of doors and drawers, contributes to everyday practicality and the elegance of the environment. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the <a href="https://www.azzurrabagni.com/it/collezioni">Azzurra</a> collections, attention to these elements is fundamental to guarantee quality solutions that meet different style and practical needs. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why the choice of openings is important</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The opening of doors and drawers is not just a matter of convenience; it is a design element that can influence the overall perception of space. A careful choice of openings can make the bathroom more spacious, ergonomic and intuitive to use. Furthermore, the position and type of opening can influence the visual result of the furniture, creating a modern, classic or minimalist look.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Azzurra offers a wide range of options, allowing you to adapt each piece of bathroom furniture to your personal taste and practical needs, thanks to three main opening solutions: <strong>recessed handle</strong>, <strong>integrated handle</strong> and <strong>external handle</strong>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gorge opening: minimalism and elegance</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The groove opening is one of the most popular choices for those who prefer a minimalist and clean design. This solution, characterised by the absence of visible handles, allows surfaces to remain linear and uniform, emphasising the finishes and textures of the materials.
 It is an ideal choice for modern bathrooms, where the aim is to avoid visual clutter and create a sense of order and harmony.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, thanks to the groove, the cabinet is easy and safe to open: a simple hand movement is all it takes to access drawers and storage compartments. The groove solution is perfect for those who want bathroom furniture that combines <strong>essential elegance and maximum functionality</strong>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Integrated handle: practicality with style</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those seeking a compromise between minimalism and practicality, the integrated handle is a versatile and refined option. With this solution, the handle is an integral part of the front of the cabinet, designed to blend perfectly with the overall design without interrupting the linearity of the surfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The integrated handle offers a touch of modernity and provides excellent grip while maintaining a sober and discreet aesthetic line. This solution is ideal for those who want an elegant look but prefer a slightly more visible surface than the groove.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">External handle: a classic and functional touch</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the external handle is the <strong>most traditional solution</strong>. This type of opening is designed for those who want to accentuate details and create a focal point within the bathroom design. External handles can be selected in different shapes and finishes, transforming each piece of furniture into an element of character and personality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The presence of the external handle also allows you to play with contrasts of materials and colours, a perfect choice for those who love contemporary style with touches of originality. </p>
