The handles define the design of the Lime Ø collection by Azzurra.




<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Azzurra presents <strong>Lime Ø,</strong> a new catalogue that redefines the concept of the contemporary bathroom, introducing <strong>fifteen different compositions</strong>, defined by the type of door and drawer opening and, in particular, by the wide variety of <strong>handles</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From simple functional elements, these become precious aesthetic details, becoming<strong> true protagonists of the composition's design. </strong>Materials, shapes and finishes for every style and taste allow you to customise your bathroom design to suit every need, both practical and aesthetic. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's discover the main features of the Lime Ø collection and how this new system can transform the bathroom into a unique and refined environment, maximising the visual impact of a simple and fundamental element such as the bathroom cabinet handle.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A minimalist design with maximum practicality</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lime Ø collection stands out for its minimalist and elegant approach, in which every element is designed to <strong>combine aesthetics and functionality</strong>. The distinctive feature of the system is the <strong>introduction of a wide range of handles</strong> on the fronts of the base units and columns, a detail that adds value to customisation and ensures maximum practicality of use.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lime Ø bathroom furniture system enhances the presence of the handle, elevating it to a <strong>design element</strong>. The catalogue offers a wide range of compositions to choose from, featuring the Aster, Brio, Club, Delta, Diva, Fly, Gate, Grip, Lateral, Level, Like, ML, Simple and Stilo handles.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Added to these is the Push&Pull opening, because in this collection the handle stands out even when it is completely absent.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Additional finishes enhance the Lime Ø compositions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lime Ø collection not only offers a wide choice of handles as a distinctive feature, but also allows each composition to be further customised with exclusive details that enhance its elegance and character.
 Among the most refined options are the <strong>Cannettato</strong> and <strong>Cambio Senso Vena</strong> finishes, two solutions that add aesthetic depth and texture to bathroom furniture.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong>Cannettato </strong>with its three-dimensionality transforms the fronts of the furniture into surfaces with a strong visual impact, playing with the rhythm of vertical or horizontal lines.
 The <strong>Cannettato Simmetrico</strong> or <strong>Asimmetrico</strong> creates a sophisticated effect of movement, enhancing the texture of the finishes and giving a unique identity to the composition.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong>Cambio Senso Vena </strong>emphasises the natural beauty of wood grain or stone-effect finishes, reversing the direction of the grain to create a dynamic and refined contrast. This technique allows you to <strong>play with textures and light</strong>, giving the furniture even greater depth and a more intense perception of the material.
