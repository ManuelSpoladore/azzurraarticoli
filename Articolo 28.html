<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The standard height of a bathroom sink</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's start with a golden rule: in general, the recommended height for a washbasin is 85 centimetres. This measurement is widely adopted by professional plumbers and is a versatile option that suits most people. However, remember that this height is a starting point and can be customised as needed. </p>

<p>For people who are taller than average, the washbasin mounting holes should be moved slightly higher, up to 10 centimetres above the standard. Conversely, for people of shorter stature, it is possible to go below the standard threshold of 85 cm.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Washbasins for people with disabilities</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Further considerations must be made for washbasins designed for people with disabilities, for whom it is important to adapt the height to their specific needs. A washbasin for a wheelchair user, for example, should have a top edge height of 80 centimetres from the floor. This height allows for easy manoeuvrability under the wheelchair and comfortable access to the washbasin.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What about children?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In most cases, a non-slip stool is sufficient to make the sink accessible at their height. However, if you want to furnish a bathroom specifically for children, useful for designing a nursery school or other rooms specifically dedicated to children, you can consider a height of about 50 centimetres for the washbasin. This is considered the optimal height for children under 8 years of age.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing the washbasin and height</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to user height and specific requirements, also consider the type of washbasin you are selecting. Countertop washbasins, for example, require a specific height, while built-in washbasins require consideration of the countertop or vanity unit.
