How to organise the bathroom with a small child



<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you have a small child, the bathroom becomes one of the most used rooms in the house and, at the same time, one of the most difficult to manage. It is where many daily routines take place, from bath time to brushing teeth. Organising it so that it is functional, safe, and suitable for everyone's needs can seem like a challenge, but with the right solutions, it is possible to create a practical and welcoming space without compromising on style.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A bathroom designed with children in mind is not only more practical, but also encourages the development of your child's independence. For example, using a <strong>non-slip stool</strong> in front of the sink allows your child to reach the sink without difficulty, encouraging them to perform simple daily tasks without adult help, such as washing their hands.</p>

<p>In addition, choosing a bathroom cabinet with a <strong>child-friendly sink</strong>, positioned lower than standard models, further promotes independence. A lower sink allows children to interact more with their surroundings, making everyday activities more natural and less frustrating.</p>

<p>Adding accessories such as <strong>small mirrors</strong> or mirrors with adjustable angles can improve your child's perception of personal care by allowing them to see their reflection.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Safety</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A child-friendly bathroom must first and foremost be <strong>safe</strong>. This environment hides many dangers, from slippery floors to protruding edges on furniture. To create a safe environment, solutions must be introduced to reduce any type of risk:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><strong>Non-slip mats</strong>: placed in front of the sink and in the shower or bathtub, these can make all the difference, reducing the risk of falls and slips.</li>
  <li><strong>Corner protectors on furniture</strong>: small children who are beginning to explore their surroundings do not pay attention to protruding corners. Installing soft protectors can prevent the risk of injury.</li>
  <li><strong>Electrical socket covers</strong>: a simple and effective measure to prevent curious children from inserting objects into sockets.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Furniture and surfaces</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When designing a family bathroom, the choice of furniture and surfaces is crucial. Bathroom furniture must be designed to withstand daily knocks and stains, while also being easy to clean to ensure a hygienic environment at all times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scratch-proof, fingerprint-proof, and abrasion-resistant surfaces are the ideal choice for a bathroom designed for children. Materials such as Azzurra's soft-touch lacquers offer a matt, soft-touch surface with low light reflection that is resistant to fingerprints and scratches, which can occur with daily use.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Playful and practical design</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, don't forget the accessories! They play a fundamental role in making the environment more cheerful and welcoming without sacrificing style and elegance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><strong>Brightly coloured towel rails</strong> add character to the bathroom.</li>
  <li><strong>Organised storage containers</strong>, such as plastic baskets with fun patterns, can keep everything tidy and stimulate your child's imagination.</li>
  <li><strong>Wall stickers</strong>, easy to apply and remove, are another way to make the room more personal and fun. They can be changed as your child grows, adapting the design to their needs and preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p>But don't forget style! Small decorative details, such as a modern soap dish or a more sophisticated lamp, can give the bathroom an elegant and refined look.</p>
