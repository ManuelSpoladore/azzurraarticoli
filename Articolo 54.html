<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In every bathroom design project, the <strong>choice of accessories </strong>can really make the difference in creating a welcoming space with a unique character. Accessories are not just decorative details, but real design elements that contribute to <strong>aesthetic harmony</strong> and everyday <strong>practicality</strong>.
 We have collected some ideas here to inspire you for your bathroom.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why bathroom accessories are important</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bathroom accessories are the finishing touch that completes and defines a space, adding <strong>personality and functionality</strong>. A towel rack or mirror are not only essential bathroom furnishings, but can also reflect the style you have chosen for your home, creating visual continuity between furniture, floors and walls.
 What's more, well-designed accessories help to organise the space better, improving the usability of the room.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The right accessories for every bathroom style</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The choice of accessories depends on the style you want to achieve. In a minimalist bathroom, for example, accessories should be discreet and blend in with the clean lines of the furniture. Materials such as satin-finish steel or glass can enhance the <strong>clean and tidy</strong> look of the space.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a more classic bathroom, on the other hand, you can opt for accessories with decorative details or in warm materials such as bronze or wood. The result will be a welcoming environment, where every element seems to tell a story.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Contemporary bathrooms, on the other hand, often play with <strong>textural and colour contrasts</strong>: accessories in matt finishes or bright colours can become the real stars of the room. In our proposals, every accessory can be coordinated with the bathroom furniture for a coherent and refined look. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Functionality and order: accessories that improve everyday life</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bathroom accessories are not just decorative: they play a fundamental role in keeping the environment tidy and functional. Think, for example, of towel hooks, soap dispensers or toothbrush holders. These items help to organise the space, reducing clutter and improving the <strong>usability</strong> of the bathroom.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mirrors with integrated lighting, for example, combine aesthetics and technology to provide optimal light for everyday activities such as applying make-up or shaving. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to choose the right accessories</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choosing bathroom accessories requires attention to detail.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some useful tips.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Materials and finishes</strong>: it is best to opt for materials that are resistant to humidity and easy to clean, such as stainless steel or tempered glass.
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Stylistic consistency</strong>: accessories should be in harmony with the overall design of the bathroom. For example, a modern bathroom requires minimal accessories, while a more rustic style goes well with wooden or ceramic details.
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Coordinated colours</strong>: it is advisable to choose accessories that blend in with the tones of the furniture and walls for a harmonious effect. The Azzurra collections offer a range of colours and finishes that make every room unique. </li>
