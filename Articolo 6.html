<p>Bathing your pet can be a challenge, especially if your pet doesn't like water or is too big or heavy to lift. To make this task easier and more enjoyable, you can follow these tips:</p>

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Place a <strong>non-slip mat</strong> in the shower to prevent you or your pet from slipping and hurting yourselves.
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Clean and hygienic, to prevent the spread of bacteria and mould.
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
