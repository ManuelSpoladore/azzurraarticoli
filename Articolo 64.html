Minimalist bathroom: a design that improves mental wellbeing





<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a fast-paced world, design is also constantly evolving. Trends that seem indispensable today are already outdated tomorrow. Yet there is <strong>one style that does not follow fashion, but transcends it</strong>. It is essential, elegant and timeless. We are talking about <strong>minimalist design</strong>, an aesthetic philosophy that revolutionises your spaces, but can also improve your <strong>mental well-being.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because living in a <strong>simple, tidy, essential</strong> environment also means living with <strong>less stress</strong> and more clarity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Minimalism is more than a philosophy, it is a way to redefine your environment, starting with your furnishings. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is minimalism?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting out as an artistic movement, minimalism quickly left the art galleries and entered our activities, our wardrobes and, more generally, our homes. The most famous phrase that embodies this philosophy is “Less is more”, attributed to modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. A simple, almost minimalist principle, but a powerful one: remove the superfluous to enhance what really matters.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Minimalism means <strong>choosing</strong>. It means <strong>freeing yourself from visual noise</strong>, both mental and material, to make <strong>room for simplicity</strong>. It means prioritising quality over quantity. Even on a scientific level, research shows that less chaotic environments, with fewer objects and stimuli, are associated with lower levels of cortisol (the stress hormone) and <strong>greater mental clarity</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A simple step towards adopting a minimalist lifestyle is to redefine your environment: even your home can reflect this new vision. Simple, functional furnishings help the mind to remain free and focused.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Start with the bathroom, a place often cluttered with products and accessories that we accumulate without any real need for daily use. Making it tidy and harmonious could be a turning point in always feeling tranquillity in the room where you start and end your days.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>Features of a minimalist bathroom</strong></strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The space in a minimalist bathroom is organised in a rational way. The use of suspended furniture and clean lines frees up the floor and makes the room look tidier. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are no handles, which are replaced by <strong>recessed or push-pull opening systems</strong>, maintaining maximum <strong>visual cleanliness</strong>. The colours follow a <strong>neutral palette</strong>, ranging from white to light grey to dove grey or pastel shades.
 The finishes can be soft touch, giving a soft and delicate feel.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong>mirror</strong>, a functional<strong> </strong>and decorative element, follows the same minimalist approach: simple, rectangular or round shapes, with integrated LED lighting around the perimeter or backlighting. The <strong>washbasin </strong>has essential shapes, often integrated into the top or countertop, with smooth, thin surfaces in ceramic or composite materials. Finally, the <strong>sanitary ware </strong>also follows the same style: it is compact, suspended and with a flush-to-wall drain, thanks to <a href="https://magazine.azzurrabagni.com/2024/wally-sistema-salvaspazio-bagno/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">space-saving solutions such as the Wally system by Azzurra</a>. The shapes are rounded or slightly square, for a light and tidy look.
