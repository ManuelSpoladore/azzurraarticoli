<h3>1. Assign a specific place for personal care products</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When carrying out daily personal hygiene or beauty routines, we often tend to leave toothbrushes, combs, sponges or detergents lying around on the <a href="https://www.azzurrabagni.com/it/lavabi-piani" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>sink</strong></a>. To avoid this constant accumulation of accessories, it is important to assign a specific place for each item and store these products in their containers on shelves or in cabinets.

<h3>2. Organise the inside of your cabinets</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even the most hidden areas are important: if you manage to keep the inside of your bathroom cabinets tidy, it will then be more natural and almost automatic to maintain a perfect balance throughout the room. To achieve this, simply equip the drawers, wall units and base units under the washbasin with special containers. The <strong>drawers of <a href="https://www.azzurrabagni.com/it/collezioni" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azzurra furniture</a></strong>, for example, can be conveniently fitted with practical <strong>dividers of various sizes</strong>.</p>

<h3>3. Set aside a space for cleaning products</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All cleaning products should be kept tidy (and out of reach of children or pets). It is best to dedicate a hidden and inaccessible space to these items and, if the layout of the rooms allows it, you can create a real <a href="https://www.azzurrabagni.
com/it/collezione/wash‘ target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>laundry area</strong></a>, dedicated to both cleaning products and laundry.

<h3>4. Clean the sink, mirror, toilet and floor regularly</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sink and toilet are the two most frequently used items in a bathroom, so it goes without saying that it is essential to keep them clean at all times to prevent the spread of bacteria. A quick wipe of the mirror is also very useful for making the bathroom look brighter: the same room with a mirror covered in water droplets would look completely different. Finally, don't forget to clean the floor regularly, drying it thoroughly to prevent mould or limescale stains from forming.

<h3>5. Empty the rubbish bin regularly</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember to empty the bin regularly. Items such as toilet paper, sanitary towels and other personal care products can cause bacteria to accumulate and develop unpleasant odours. It is best to organise yourself to empty the bin frequently, possibly adding a pleasant-smelling bag.
