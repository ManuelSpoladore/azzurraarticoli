<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first criterion for sorting clothes in the washing machine is colour. Separate white items from coloured items and, among the latter, distinguish between bright colours and dark or pastel colours. This will prevent colours from transferring from one item to another and whites from turning grey or yellow.

<p>If you have new garments or garments with very intense colours, such as red or blue, we recommend washing them separately the first few times, as they may release more colour than others. You can also use specific products to fix colours or colour-catching towels, which absorb excess dye.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sort garments by fabric type</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second criterion for sorting clothes in the washing machine is the fabric. Each material has different characteristics and requires a suitable temperature and spin cycle. For example, cotton garments can be washed at high temperatures and spun for a long time, while wool or silk garments should be washed at low temperatures and with a gentle spin cycle. </p>

<p>To find out how to treat each fabric, simply read the garment labels, where you will find symbols indicating the washing instructions. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sort garments by degree of soiling</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third criterion for sorting clothes in the washing machine is the degree of soiling. It is not a good idea to wash very dirty clothes, such as sportswear or stained items, together with lightly soiled clothes, such as those worn only once or underwear. This is because very dirty clothes could contaminate lightly soiled clothes and require a longer and more intensive wash cycle.
