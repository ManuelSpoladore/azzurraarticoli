<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to choose the right handle for your bathroom</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The choice of handle depends on several factors:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>✔ Bathroom style:</strong> if you want a modern, minimalist look, <strong>integrated handles</strong> or <strong>recessed handles</strong> are the ideal choice. For a more classic or decorative effect, you can opt for <strong>external handles</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>✔ Practicality:</strong> integrated handles offer a clean aesthetic effect, but if you prefer a firmer and more comfortable grip, external handles could be the best solution.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>✔ Customisation:</strong> with the variety of finishes and colours available in the Azzurra collections, you can create exactly the style you want.
