<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is scent design?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still little known to those outside the industry, scent design refers to the <strong>art of designing the scent of a space</strong>.
 This takes into account not only the architectural, aesthetic and functional characteristics of the space, but also the sensations and memories that you want to evoke in those who experience it. It is based on knowledge of the physiology of smell, the link between smells and memory, and the psychological and therapeutic properties of fragrances.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Olfactory design is not limited to diffusing a particular scent into the air, but integrates it with other elements of the design, creating a synergy between form, colour, light, sound and olfactory perception. It can therefore be defined as a form of non-verbal communication, capable of <strong>conveying a message and a certain personality</strong> through one of the most powerful and primordial senses we have.
