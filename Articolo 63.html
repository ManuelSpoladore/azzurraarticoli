<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Essential design with 45° throat opening</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The heart of the Lime 2.0 collection is the <strong>45° slanted groove opening</strong> system, an elegant and functional detail that allows for an ergonomic grip without the use of external handles. This element, which becomes the stylistic signature of the collection, can be made <strong>in the same colour as the fronts or in a contrasting colour</strong>, leaving ample room for design creativity.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The minimalist approach is also evident in the composition of the volumes: clean lines, balanced proportions and continuous surfaces that enhance every finish.
