<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Use mirrors and glass to increase space</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if it is only an illusion, visual perception is fundamental and completely changes the sensations we feel within a room. By using mirrors or glass doors and shelves, you will feel as if you have multiplied the space without having to knock down any walls. Glass is a valuable ally because it lets light through, does not create visual barriers and, through the play of reflections, makes the room feel more airy.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Try a mirror cabinet</h3>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of mirrors, these can also conceal valuable space where you can store items and hide them from view to keep your room tidy. In these cases, a mirror cabinet can be a great help.
 In addition to the classic wall-mounted models, the Azzurra catalogue also offers some interesting solutions of this type.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Choose proportionate and suspended furniture</h3>
<!-- wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another trick for optimising bathroom space is to choose furniture that is suitable for the size of the room, without going overboard on size or quantity. It is better to opt for wall-mounted furniture, which leaves the floor free and gives a feeling of lightness, and furniture with drawers or sliding doors, which are easy to open even in confined spaces. Another tip? Make the most of the space under the sink with closed or open base units, which are very useful for storing towels and accessories.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Make the most of the height of the walls</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If width is an issue, then make the most of the vertical space! Column cabinets, shelves, hooks or hangers will be your best friends in this endeavour. For a chic effect, you could also consider original solutions, such as the ladder-shaped storage unit from the Look series by Azzurra.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Order comes first</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last but not least. In fact, this is the first real rule: always keep everything tidy! Even the largest rooms can seem much smaller if they are cluttered with too many objects. In the case of a small bathroom, it is therefore essential to organise objects in special containers and use dividers inside drawers to allow you to easily find what you are looking for and keep the bathroom clean and tidy at all times.
