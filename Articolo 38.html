<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The ultimate space-saving solution</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mini washbasins are designed with the specific aim of adapting to the smallest spaces, allowing you to make the most of every available centimetre.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When well designed, compact dimensions do not prevent you from obtaining the same functionality and comfort as any other type of washbasin.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this solution by Azzurra, for example, the mini-basin leaves a small area next to the tap, ideal for a soap dispenser or sanitiser. Other personal hygiene and beauty products can then be stored on shelves and racks of various kinds organised at different heights on the wall.

<p>Not only that, but the small size of this mini washbasin conceals a real treasure chest, as the space underneath the washbasin has been maximised to create a compartment with a door, ideal for storing items neatly and discreetly.
