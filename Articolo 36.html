<p>Before choosing furniture, it is important to plan the layout of the space carefully. Assess the <strong>size of your laundry area</strong> and identify your specific needs. Ask yourself if you need more space to store cleaning products and hang laundry or if you would like to have an additional sink. Good planning will allow you to select exactly the right furniture for you.

 This can be used for hand washing, cleaning stubborn stains and making it easier to take care of clothes, shoes and particularly bulky items. A convenient <strong>worktop</strong> will also be very useful for folding clothes and as a support surface for everyday tasks.
