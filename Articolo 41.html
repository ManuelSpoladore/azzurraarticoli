<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Follow Your Style</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first tip is to follow your personal style when decorating your bathroom, by choosing colors that best suit your personality and taste. There are no right or wrong colors for the bathroom, only colors that reflect your preferences. For example, if you love a <strong>classic</strong> style, you can go for white, beige, gray, or black, whose shades always guarantee an elegant and refined effect. If you prefer something more <strong>original</strong>, you can be bold with brighter and more vivid tones, such as red, green, blue, or yellow — perfect for expressing energy and vibrancy.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Don’t Overdo the Color Variety</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Try not to use too many different colors in the same bathroom, as this can result in a chaotic and unbalanced look. To avoid this issue, you can follow the <strong>"60-30-10 rule"</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Choose three colors that complement each other;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Use one of them—preferably the most neutral—for 60% of the space;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Use the most contrasting color for 30% of the decor;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Finally, use the remaining color sparingly 10% to highlight certain details.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p>Finding the perfect color balance isn’t always easy, but with professional advice—like that offered by Azzurra bathroom furniture retailers—you’ll find the ideal solution for your needs.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Balance Color Intensity</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avoid using colors that are all too intense or too dull together, as this can create an unpleasant and tiring effect.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Consider the Size of the Bathroom</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your color choice should also depend on the <strong>available space</strong>, since colors significantly affect the visual perception of the environment. As a general rule:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Light colors help make the space appear larger;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Dark colors should be used only to create focal points or emphasize details;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>You can use glossy or reflective surfaces to bounce light and enhance the sense of space.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
