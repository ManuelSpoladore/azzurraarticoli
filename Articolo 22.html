How to clean your washing machine



<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The washing machine is one of the most used appliances in the home, but also one of the most neglected when it comes to cleaning and maintenance. We often just put in the detergent and select the programme, without worrying about removing dirt, limescale and bacteria that accumulate in the drum, filter, drain hose and detergent drawer. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cleaning the drum</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The drum is the part of the washing machine that comes into direct contact with the items to be washed, so it is important that it is always clean and sanitised. To do this, simply run a wash cycle with hot water (at least 60°C) and add a glass of white vinegar or lemon juice instead of detergent. These natural products help dissolve limescale and eliminate bacteria. If the drum has mould or rust stains, you can use a sponge soaked in hydrogen peroxide or baking soda and gently scrub the affected areas.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cleaning the filter</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The filter is a key component of the washing machine, as it traps impurities that come off the clothes during washing, such as lint, hair, coins or buttons. If it is not cleaned regularly, it can block the water flow and cause malfunctions or leaks. To clean the filter, turn off the washing machine and unplug it from the mains, then open the door that hides it (usually located at the bottom of the machine) and unscrew the cap. At this point, you can remove the filter and rinse it under running water, removing any residue with the help of a brush or toothpick. Before putting the filter back in place, you can also clean the drain hose with a damp cloth.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cleaning the detergent drawer</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The detergent drawer is another part of the washing machine that tends to get dirty easily, due to detergent and fabric softener residues that solidify and create deposits. These deposits can block the holes through which the water flows and prevent the product from being distributed properly on the clothes. To clean the detergent drawer, simply remove it from its housing (usually by pulling it outwards) and wash it under running water, using a sponge or toothbrush to remove any dirt. If the drawer shows signs of mould or limescale, you can soak it in a solution of hot water and white vinegar or lemon juice for a few hours, then rinse and dry it thoroughly before putting it back in place.

<p>There are also various ‘washing machine care’ products available on the market that are useful for periodic maintenance of the appliance. Regular cleaning will ensure maximum efficiency for <strong>clean and fragrant clothes every time.</strong> Finally, remember to always leave the washing machine door open after each wash cycle to allow the drum to dry and prevent mould and unpleasant odours from forming. </p>
