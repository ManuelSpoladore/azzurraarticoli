<p>There are different types of towel rails, which vary in shape, size and installation method. Some of the most common are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wall-mounted towel rails</strong>: these are fixed to the wall near the sink, bidet or shower. They can be single or double, flag-shaped or ring-shaped. They are the classic solution for keeping towels within easy reach, but they have the disadvantage of requiring holes to be drilled in the wall for installation.</li>
  <li><strong>Towel rails integrated into bathroom furniture</strong>: these can be placed at the front or side of the countertop with sink, depending on the structure and design of the furniture. This is an aesthetically pleasing and space-saving solution.</li>
  <li><strong>Floor-standing towel rails</strong>: these rest on the floor and can be moved as desired. They come in a variety of shapes, from minimalist and linear to more creative ladder designs. They are perfect for adding a touch of originality to your bathroom.</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice of towel rack also depends on where you want to place it in the bathroom. You need to take into account the available space, the layout of the bathroom fixtures and the needs of those who use the bathroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, if the bathroom is small or long, a towel rail under the sink may be ideal, as may a towel rail with a bar parallel to the cabinet.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the bathroom is large or has two sinks, you can opt for two single towel rails to be installed next to each sink, or a double or multiple towel rail to be positioned in a strategic location.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the bathtub or shower area, it is best to choose a towel rack with at least two bars and hooks so that both towels and bathrobes can be hung up.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Design</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The aesthetics should be in harmony with the rest of the d√©cor, but also with the personality and tastes of those who use the bathroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, if the room has a classic or romantic style, you can choose wrought iron towel rails with floral or arabesque decorations. If, on the other hand, the bathroom has a modern or minimalist style, you may prefer steel or aluminium towel rails with simple, geometric lines.</p>
