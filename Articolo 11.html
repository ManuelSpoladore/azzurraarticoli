<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Choose carefully where to place your washing machine and dryer</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first thing to do is choose the location of the washing machine and dryer. If you have limited space, you can opt for a column solution, stacking the two appliances on top of each other and securing them with special safety kits. This will save you half the space and allow you to use the wall above for hanging shelves, cabinets or drying racks.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. You can make your washing machine invisible so you can put it in any room</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a concealed cabinet, you can hide your washing machine and dryer when not in use and make them accessible only when needed. This will allow you to have a clean, harmonious laundry area that blends in easily with the rest of your décor. You can choose a cabinet with sliding or hinged doors, depending on your preferences and the space available: you will find lots of inspiration in the <strong><a href="https://www.azzurrabagni.com/it/collezione/wash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lime Wash catalogue</a> </strong> by Azzurra!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Make use of a hallway or unused space</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have the opportunity to create a laundry area separate from the rest of the house, you can make use of unused space such as under the stairs, a storage room or a balcony. In this case, you will need to ensure that you have the necessary plumbing and electrical connections, as well as good ventilation.
 You can then furnish your laundry area with custom-made furniture that fits the size and shape of the space.
