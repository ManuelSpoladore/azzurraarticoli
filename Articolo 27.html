<p>White vinegar is a real ally when it comes to fighting limescale in the bathroom. Preparing a diluted solution of vinegar and water is very simple. Just pour a little into a bowl and apply it with a soft sponge to surfaces such as taps, sinks and showers.
 Leave the vinegar to work for a few minutes to dissolve the limescale, then rinse with warm water. For stubborn taps, unscrew the filters and soak them in a solution of water and vinegar overnight. You'll be amazed by the results.
