The elegance of corrugated patterns in modern interior design




<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interior design is evolving rapidly, but some details seem destined to become timeless classics. One of these is undoubtedly <strong>cannettato</strong> (or <strong>canneté</strong>), a technique that combines classic aesthetics with dynamic modernity, finding its maximum expression in the collections of <a href="https://www.azzurrabagni.com/it">Azzurra</a>. This technique, inspired by natural reeds, creates a three-dimensional texture that enriches contemporary spaces and sophisticated environments, adding depth and character to bathroom furnishings.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cannettato: a stylish detail that makes all the difference</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The interest in ribbed patterns, already strong in interior design, continues to grow worldwide. The uniqueness of this technique lies in its ability to transform flat materials into three-dimensional surfaces, where lines and shadows alternate to create a <strong>unique visual effect</strong>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This style evokes Art Deco and vintage atmospheres, reinterpreted in a contemporary key. In the bathroom, the cannettato effect creates a refined and modern aesthetic that lends itself well to both minimalist and luxurious settings. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Asymmetrical ‘A’ Type Cannettato</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The three-dimensionality of type A lies in the arrangement of the lines, which appear in an <strong>asymmetrical pattern</strong>.
 With the option of horizontal or vertical installation, the Type A ribbed pattern allows you to create a dynamic and unpredictable effect, ideal for those looking for a bathroom that expresses <strong>originality</strong>. Each module thus acquires its own movement, a personalisation that makes each project unique.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Symmetrical Type ‘B’ Cannettato</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The precision and order of the parallel lines define the Type B finish, in which symmetry creates a sense of <strong>harmony and</strong> <strong>essentiality</strong>. Here, the visual rhythm is marked by equidistant lines, which can also be positioned horizontally or vertically, making the ribbed finish a distinctive, sophisticated yet simple element. The result?
 A surface that resembles a modern bas-relief, perfect for those who love a minimalist aesthetic.
