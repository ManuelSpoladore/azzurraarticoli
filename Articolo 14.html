<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Natural light is light that comes from windows or skylights, and is the most desirable because it gives a feeling of space, cleanliness and freshness. It also saves electricity, reducing consumption and environmental impact. To make the most of it, windows should be positioned to ensure good sunlight exposure for as much of the room as possible, avoiding shadows and reflections. It is also advisable to choose reflective materials for the walls, floors and bathroom furniture in order to maximise brightness.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Artificial light</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Artificial light comes from lamps or spotlights and is necessary to supplement or replace natural light when it is insufficient or absent. It must be adapted to the different functions of the bathroom, such as using the sink and shower, relaxing or personal care. For this reason, it is essential to create different light sources that can be switched on or off as required. For example, you can install soft lighting to create a relaxing atmosphere in the bathtub, direct lighting to illuminate the mirror, and decorative lighting to highlight certain elements of the bathroom, such as wall units, plants or paintings. Finally, it is important to choose energy-efficient lamps with a colour temperature that is suitable for your bathroom. </p>
