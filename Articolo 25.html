<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Every product in its own container</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using containers, boxes, baskets and drawer dividers is essential for organising your make-up products. These will allow you to classify your products by category, for example by dividing them into eye, lip and face products, making them easier to find during your daily beauty routine. The result will be a perfectly tidy space that is more pleasant to use and even Instagram-worthy.

<p>To prevent your make-up products from expiring or becoming unusable, organise them in chronological order of opening. Use the oldest products first (making sure they are still in good condition), especially those with the shortest expiry date, to ensure proper rotation and maximise their shelf life. </p>
