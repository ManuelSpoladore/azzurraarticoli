<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Choose a coordinated colour palette</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use coordinated accessories and furnishings in a harmonious and relaxing colour palette. You can opt for shades of white, beige, grey or blue, which are neutral and versatile. Or you can add a few more vibrant accents, such as green, yellow or pink, to create contrast and cheerfulness. The important thing is that the different shades go well together and with the elements in the bathroom, such as the furniture, sink and wall units.

<p>Add a few natural elements, such as plants, flowers or scented candles. <a href="https://magazine.azzurrabagni.com/2023/7-migliori-piante-da-bagno/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plants</a> purify the air and bring freshness and vitality to the bathroom: you can choose plants that are resistant to humidity and low light, such as orchids, philodendrons or sansevieria. Flowers are perfect for decorating the sink or bathtub (if you don't have green fingers, there are many artificial solutions available that still look great). Scented candles create an intimate and romantic atmosphere, and you can choose delicate and relaxing fragrances such as lavender, vanilla or musk.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Pay attention to every detail, from towels to bath products</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pay attention to details such as towels, rugs, soaps and toiletries. Towels should be soft, clean and match the colours of the bathroom. You can also prepare a set of personalised towels for each guest, with their name or initials embroidered on them or simply by assigning different colours or symbols to each one. Soaps and toiletries should be of good quality and in sufficient quantity for all guests. If you have samples of creams, shampoos or conditioners, you can also make these available to guests to make them feel even more pampered, with a service worthy of a grand hotel!</p>
