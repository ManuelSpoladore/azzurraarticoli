<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make the most of vertical space</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most practical solutions is to <strong>stack the dryer on top of the washing machine</strong>, creating a <strong>laundry column</strong> that takes up little floor space and makes the most of the height. You can do this if you have two compatible appliances equipped with a fixing kit or by using a special column unit, such as those offered by <a href="https://www.azzurrabagni.com/it/collezione/wash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azzurra</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hide your tumble dryer with a special cabinet</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another option is to place the dryer in a cabinet or niche, perhaps using unused space such as under the sink or next to the shower. This way, you can hide the dryer from view and integrate it with the rest of the bathroom décor. To ensure good ventilation, remember to leave some space around the dryer and equip the cabinet or niche with a grille or perforated door.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Organise a proper laundry area</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, if you have the opportunity to do some <strong>renovation work</strong>, you could consider creating a laundry room separate from the bathroom, perhaps using part of the hallway or bedroom. This will give you a dedicated space for laundry, with a tumble dryer, washing machine, drying rack, ironing board and all the necessary accessories.
 This solution will allow you to free up space in the bathroom and also give you more privacy.
