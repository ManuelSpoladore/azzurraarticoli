<p>The first step in cleaning your bathroom sink properly is to choose the right product based on the material it is made of. Ceramic, Tecnoril, HPL and Fenix are some possible examples: each material has its own characteristics and requires specific care. </p>

<p>In general, it is advisable to avoid products that are too aggressive or abrasive, as they could scratch or dull surfaces. It is better to opt for mild, natural detergents, such as bicarbonate of soda, vinegar or lemon, which have degreasing, disinfecting and anti-limescale properties.
 Alternatively, you can use specific bathroom cleaners, but always read the labels carefully and follow the instructions. Also pay attention to the type of sponge used: it is best to avoid abrasive ones and opt for soft cloths.

<p>To keep your sink clean and hygienic, it is not enough to clean it once in a while, but at least once a week. This will prevent dirt from accumulating and forming stains or encrustations that are difficult to remove.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, it is advisable to do a more thorough cleaning at least once a month, using specific products to remove limescale or stubborn dirt. You can also use natural remedies, such as hot vinegar or lemon juice, which help dissolve encrustations and make surfaces shinier.
 Before doing this, however, check the characteristics of your sink and always test on a small area first.
