<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Immediately wipe up any liquid spilled on the surface</strong> to prevent stains, discolouration, limescale deposits and alterations due to absorption. Some products used in the bathroom, such as soaps, nail polish, perfumes, hair dyes, etc., can damage the surface of the wood.
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Try not to let water stand on the surface</strong>, and take immediate action in case of leaks, calling the retailer to avoid damage to the furniture underneath. Wood is particularly sensitive to water and steam, which can cause swelling, cracks, deformation and mould.
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Avoid exposing the surface to excessive heat sources</strong>, such as hair dryers, hair straighteners, irons, etc., which can overheat the wood surface and cause breakage, discolouration or fire.
 When using these items, place them on an insulating surface and not directly on the worktop.
<li><strong>Remember that dragging objects across the surface may scratch it. </strong>Always use a trivet or coaster to place hot or cold objects on the surface. Never use metal scourers, abrasive substances or powdered detergents, which may scratch the wood.
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>For normal maintenance, use a soft cloth </strong>or microfibre cloth or a soft bristle brush, following the direction of the wood grain. <strong>For more intensive cleaning, use a specific product</strong> for cleaning wood that does not scratch and is suitable for the type of finish.
 Rinse with a well-wrung cloth and dry all surfaces thoroughly to avoid streaks or dullness. Never use undiluted alcohol, acetic acid, chlorine, ammonia, acetone, trichloroethylene or other aggressive solvents, which may stain or discolour the wood.
