<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Relaxing materials and colours</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finishes and shades are essential for creating the right atmosphere. Let yourself be inspired by nature, making room for materials such as wood, stone, bamboo, linen and cotton to create a comfortable environment that gives you a feeling of serenity, balance and relaxation. As for colours, opt for a neutral palette with shades ranging from white to beige and grey, possibly combined with a few other soft tones.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Furnishings between simplicity and elegance</h2>

<p>The choice of furnishings and accessories will also influence the atmosphere of your spa-style bathroom.
 Once again, neutral colours are the protagonists, both for furniture and accessories, such as wall units, chests of drawers, shelves, towel rails and display cabinets.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opt for functional and essential furniture compositions that are also elegant and have a touch of luxury. An excellent choice is to use wall-mounted furniture to give a sense of lightness, creating an airy and even more pleasant environment to live in.<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Accessories for a welcoming touch</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>Accessories are also essential for personalising every corner of the room and making it truly welcoming.
