Suspended bases: the unstoppable trend in bathroom furnishings




<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among bathroom furnishing trends, the use of wall-mounted bases has been established for some time and is increasingly in demand. Bathroom furniture that does not rest on the floor but is fixed to the wall with special supports has several advantages, both from an aesthetic and practical point of view. Let's take a look at them together.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Aesthetic advantages</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suspended bases give the room a lighter, more elegant and modern look. They create an empty space between the furniture and the floor, which expands the visual perception of the room and enhances its brightness. They also allow you to play with shapes, colours and materials, creating contrasts and harmony with the walls and other elements in the bathroom. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Practical advantages</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suspended base units are also very functional and easy to clean. As they are raised off the floor, they do not accumulate dust and dirt underneath, making maintenance quicker and easier. They also leave more free space on the floor, facilitating movement and accessibility. This is particularly useful in small or narrow bathrooms, where wall-hung vanity units allow you to optimise the available space.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to choose wall-mounted vanity units</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To choose the most suitable wall-mounted vanity units for your bathroom, you will need to consider a number of factors, such as the size and style you want. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The measurements naturally depend on the space available and your storage needs. You can opt for single or double solutions, with drawers or doors, with an integrated or countertop washbasin. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Style is a matter of personal taste, but it should also harmonise with the rest of the décor. You can choose from minimalist or detailed designs, made from different materials, in plain colours or with contrasting finishes.
