<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Knowing the material: the first step to effective cleaning</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first step in cleaning your bathroom floor properly is to <strong>know the material</strong>. Each surface has different characteristics and needs:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><strong>Porcelain stoneware</strong> is a very common choice in bathrooms due to its durability and ease of maintenance. However, even this material can accumulate dirt in the grout lines, requiring more thorough cleaning.</li>
  <li><strong>Ceramic</strong>, similar to stoneware, is sturdy and easy to clean, but may require specific products to prevent limescale from damaging the surface.</li>
  <li><strong>Treated or laminated wood</strong> is one of the most delicate options, and it is essential to use less water when cleaning to prevent the material from warping or deteriorating.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The right products for bathroom floors</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choosing the right <strong>cleaning products</strong> is crucial for achieving optimal results without damaging surfaces. Here are some useful tips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><strong>Neutral detergents</strong>: these are the safest choice for most materials. They do not leave sticky residues and do not damage the floor finish.</li>
  <li><strong>Diluted white vinegar</strong>: useful for removing limescale and mould stains, but should be avoided on materials such as marble or wood, as it may corrode them.</li>
  <li><strong>Specific detergents</strong>: many materials, such as treated wood or matt stoneware, benefit from products designed specifically for their maintenance.</li>
</ul>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":1} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1">
  <li><strong>Remove dust</strong>: use a vacuum cleaner or a soft-bristled broom to remove hair, dust and surface debris.</li>
  <li><strong>Prepare the cleaning solution</strong>: dilute the chosen detergent in warm water, following the recommended doses.</li>
  <li><strong>Wash the floor</strong>: use a soft cloth or a well-wrung mop to avoid water stagnation, especially on wooden or laminate floors.</li>
  <li><strong>Dry immediately</strong>: to avoid water marks and stains, dry the floor with a dry cloth or leave it to dry naturally in a well-ventilated area.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for grout and details</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Floor joints are often the most difficult place to clean, but also one of the most important. To keep them white and hygienic, use a mixture of bicarbonate of soda and water or a specific detergent. A soft-bristled brush is ideal for reaching even the most difficult corners.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Daily maintenance for floors that always shine</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frequent, light cleaning can prevent dirt from building up and simplify more thorough maintenance. After showering or bathing, for example, dry any water droplets with a cloth to prevent stains or limescale residues from forming.</p>
