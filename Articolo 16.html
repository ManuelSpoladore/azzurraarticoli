<p>Water is a precious and limited resource that must be used responsibly and consciously, starting with <strong>good habits at home</strong>, as suggested by the recent communication campaign <a href="https://www.governo.it/it/media/campagna-di-comunicazione-sul-risparmio-di-acqua/22383‘ target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">’Water is life, don't waste it"</a>, launched by the Department for Information and Publishing of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.

<p>One of the rooms in the house where water is used most is undoubtedly the bathroom, a place that holds no secrets for us at Azzurra. So we asked ourselves what advice we could give you to avoid waste, and here is our list of five daily actions to <strong>save water in the bathroom</strong> and help protect the planet.

<li><strong>Turn off the tap</strong> when brushing your teeth, shaving or combing your hair. This simple gesture can save up to 10 litres of water per minute.

<li><strong>Take showers instead of baths</strong>. A 5-minute shower uses about 40 litres of water, while a bath requires about 150 litres. You can also install a flow reducer on your shower head, which limits the amount of water dispensed without compromising the quality of the clean.
 And if you take advantage of your shower to exfoliate, shave or give yourself a long massage while lathering up, always remember not to leave the tap running when you don't need it.
<li><strong>Adjust the water temperature</strong> before turning it on, avoiding letting it run unnecessarily to reach the desired temperature. You can use a thermostat or mixer tap to set the optimal temperature and maintain a constant flow of hot and cold water.

<li><strong>Check for leaks</strong>&nbsp;in taps, showers, sinks and toilets. A single drop per second can waste 30 litres per day. If you notice any leaks, try to repair them as soon as possible by replacing seals or faulty parts.
 It's a good choice for the environment and your wallet.

<li><strong>Run washing machines on a full load and on the eco programme. </strong>You can also save water when doing your laundry. Avoid running the machine half-empty and wash several items together, preferably at low temperatures. </li>
