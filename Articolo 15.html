<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Divide detergents according to their use</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A simple and effective way to organise detergents is to divide them according to their use. Group them into categories, separating laundry detergents from surface cleaners (floors, furniture and glass), and keep the same division for all cleaning tools, such as sponges, cloths and rags. This will prevent you from mixing up products and wasting time looking for them every time you need them.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Take advantage of the internal structure of your cabinets</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can keep different types of detergents well separated by organising the interior of your cabinets in the most functional way possible, depending on the space you have available. Shelves, drawers and dividers will be your greatest allies in achieving impeccable order and cleanliness!

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Declutter regularly</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How many times have you found yourself looking at the same large, bulky bottle of detergent that is almost empty, even though you opened a new one some time ago? Or how many times have you continued to open new alternative products, only to let them expire? Try to reduce everything to the essentials, get rid of what you don't use and avoid impulse purchases: you'll soon find yourself with a much tidier, cleaner and waste-free laundry area.
