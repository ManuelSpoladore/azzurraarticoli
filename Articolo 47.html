<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The advantages of having a rug in the bathroom</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adding a rug to your bathroom can greatly improve the comfort and atmosphere of the room. <strong>A rug adds warmth</strong> and a welcoming feel, especially in modern bathrooms with surfaces such as stoneware or marble, which can appear visually “cold”.
 In addition, a rug helps keep your feet warm in colder seasons and can be positioned to absorb any water splashes, protecting the floor from stains and moisture.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From an aesthetic point of view, a well-chosen rug can also become a design element in its own right, capable of enhancing the entire space. <strong>Colours and textures</strong> can create a focal point that enriches the bathroom, especially if you decide to combine it with neutral tones or the more vibrant colours of the Azzurra collections.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The disadvantages: hygiene and humidity</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, rugs in the bathroom also have <strong>some</strong> <strong>drawbacks</strong>, especially in terms of hygiene. Being exposed to a humid environment with possible water splashes, rugs can easily become a breeding ground for mould and bacteria.
 Maintenance is therefore essential: bathroom rugs should be washed frequently and dried thoroughly to prevent unpleasant odours from developing.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Safety is also an aspect that should not be underestimated: a bathroom rug must have a non-slip backing to prevent it from becoming dangerous, especially when wet. Opting for rugs specifically designed for damp environments is essential to ensure durability and safety.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for choosing the right rug: materials and colours</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choosing the <strong>right material</strong> is the first step in ensuring that your rug is as functional as it is attractive. Recommended materials include cotton, which is easy to wash and dries quickly, and microfibre, which has good moisture absorption and dries quickly, reducing the risk of mould. If you are looking for a more luxurious effect, bamboo or treated wood can also be considered, provided you choose a product that is properly designed to withstand moisture.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From an <strong>aesthetic</strong> point of view, the colour of the rug should complement the design of the bathroom. In smaller bathrooms, you can opt for light or neutral colours, which help to give the impression of more space.
 For larger rooms or for those who want to add a touch of liveliness, intense colours or decorative patterns can take centre stage.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice of a rug for the bathroom depends on personal preferences and practical needs.
 If chosen with care and maintained properly, a rug can be an element that adds comfort and style to this space. However, it is essential to evaluate the materials carefully and ensure that it is always kept dry and clean to avoid unpleasant inconveniences.
