Furnishing solutions to conceal the washing machine



<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A washing machine is an essential household appliance, but it is often difficult to find the right place for it. If you do not have a dedicated laundry room, you can create a piece of furniture specifically designed to hide the washing machine, which can be placed in the bathroom or in any other corner of the house, depending on the layout of the building and the rooms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To create an invisible laundry area, you can draw inspiration from the endless possibilities offered by Azzurra's <a href="https://www.azzurrabagni.com/it/collezione/wash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lime Wash</a> collection.

<p><strong>Furniture with classic or folding doors</strong> will be your best ally for hiding your washing machine when not in use. This solution is practical and versatile, allowing you to easily access the washing machine and hide it from view when not needed. You can opt for very compact solutions, ideal for adding to a hallway, near the kitchen or in the living area. </p>

<p>If you need to hide your dryer as well as your washing machine, you can still optimise your space by choosing column cabinets, designed to withstand the weight and stress of this type of appliance when placed vertically. Here too, there are different types of door openings available for maximum functionality.

<p>Solutions like these are also ideal for creating larger cabinets where you can store all your cleaning products or neatly organise tools and equipment that are only used occasionally throughout the year.
