<strong>An intimate, welcoming and personal space. </strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A space where you can find the right inspiration to design your bathroom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this and much more is the </span><b>new Azzurra magazine</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, tailor-made for you, just like our bathroom furniture solutions.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our concept of the bathroom is as a living space, and we have always created high-quality, entirely Italian-made products to maximise comfort in the bathroom.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>collections </b><b><i>Lime 0, Lime 1.0, Lime 2.0 </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Lime Wash</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;‘>have followed the evolution of </span><b>aesthetic trends</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>functional requirements</b><span style=’font-weight: 400;">, always standing out for their elegance, discretion, maximum attention to detail and, above all,</span><b> endless possibilities for customisation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, because Azzurra is much more than a bathroom furniture brand.
 Azzurra is synonymous with </span><b><i>system</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, thanks to the modular solutions of its bathroom furniture, and with </span><b><i>service</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to designers and end customers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we want to expand our service once again to be even closer to those who place their trust in us every day and choose us as their partner. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are doing this by creating this new space, a magazine entirely dedicated to the world of bathrooms, which we will gradually furnish with articles on trends and inspiration, practical guides and useful tips.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we are opening the doors of our new home for the first time, where we are truly happy to welcome you whenever you wish.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to the Azzurra magazine. <strong>The bathroom of your dreams is here.
