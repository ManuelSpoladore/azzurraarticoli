<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cleo is a collection of open wall units with painted metal sides that stands out for its three-sided opening and is available in both vertical and horizontal versions in different heights and widths. Its design allows individual modules to be combined to create a uniform effect. The range of finishes available gives these wall units an elegant touch, together with a final impression of great lightness.

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An <strong>original, unexpected and totally different take</strong> on the classic wall unit concept. The character of Kros is immediately recognisable by its <strong>diagonal back panel</strong>, whose variation in width is followed step by step by its shelves, closed on the vertical side by a thin and refined metal side panel. Its ends therefore break all the rules, allowing the creation of original and unexpected compositions.

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>30 cm high, 20 cm wide and three different depths: 15, 20 and 25 cm. With these simple dimensions, the <strong>small wall unit </strong>Cube is suitable for furnishing any wall. In smaller spaces, it becomes an essential storage solution and a <strong>surprising eye-catcher</strong>. In larger spaces, it can be the starting point for creating the most original compositions. Unexpectedly, the front is closed and the opening is on the sides, offering an optical effect that is always different depending on the viewer's perspective.
