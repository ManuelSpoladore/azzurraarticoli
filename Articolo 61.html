<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong>new Lime 1.0 catalogue</strong> by Azzurra presents an essential and sophisticated vision of bathroom furnishings, where clean lines are combined with a variety of finishes, materials and opening systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Designed for those seeking a balance between minimalist design and distinctive character, Lime 1.0 offers modular and compact solutions that can be adapted to both small and large spaces, always with personality and elegance, defined by <strong>four different types of integrated handles.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Integrated handles: identity and functionality in a single gesture</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the distinctive features of Lime 1.0 is the design of the four <a href="https://magazine.azzurrabagni.com/2025/guida-maniglie-mobili-bagno-azzurra/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">handles</a> that define it, each with a precise aesthetic identity, allowing you to choose the language that best suits your style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><strong>Nest</strong> is applied along the upper edge of the door and has a satin nickel or lacquered profile for a comfortable and discreet grip.</li>
  <li><strong>Jey</strong> is characterised by a recess carved directly into the door to create a visual and material effect of continuity.</li>
  <li><strong>Tratto</strong> stands out for its slightly raised L-shaped metal profile, available in various configurations.</li>
  <li><strong>Lofty</strong> creates a visually clean groove effect and is available in all 58 matt lacquered colours to match the same finish as the door leaf.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These solutions interpret the function of the opening not only in a practical way, but also as a true style element.</p>
