<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The shape of the washbasin can affect how easy it is to clean. <strong>Rounded washbasins</strong>, for example, allow water to flow easily and require less attention to the corners, where dirt and soap residue tend to accumulate. For these washbasins, it is advisable to use a soft cloth and mild detergents, which remove stains and streaks without scratching the curved surface.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ceramic washbasins are durable and easy to maintain, but it is always best to avoid abrasive cleaners, which can dull the surface. A neutral detergent and a soft cloth are sufficient to keep your ceramic washbasin looking shiny. For more stubborn stains, such as limescale, a little diluted white vinegar can be used, but in moderation and without leaving the product on for too long.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mineral marble is created by combining minerals and acrylic resins to obtain a washbasin that is particularly resistant to scratches, stains, heat and impact. Cleaning therefore does not require any special precautions, although it is always advisable to follow the instructions in the manual provided by the retailer with the product.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some washbasins have <strong>special finishes</strong>, such as coloured coatings or matt effects, which require special care when cleaning. To avoid scratches and discolouration, it is best to use gentle products, preferably microfibre cloths and warm water. Matt finishes, in particular, can be more prone to showing fingerprints and smears; in these cases, a dry cloth and a specific detergent will help to keep the surface spotless without altering its appearance.</p>
