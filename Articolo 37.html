<p>The first trick is to offer your cat an alternative scratching post, i.e. an object specifically designed to satisfy its need to scratch. The scratching post must be sturdy, stable, tall and attract your cat's attention. You can choose from various models, such as column, mat, ramp or house-shaped posts. The important thing is that it is placed in a location that is easily accessible and visible to your cat, preferably near its bed or favourite spot. To encourage your cat to use the scratching post, you can also spray it with a special calming pheromone-based product or rub a little catnip on it.

<p>It is also useful to try to distract your cat continuously with interactive toys, i.e. objects that stimulate its curiosity and intelligence. By keeping your cat constantly occupied and entertained, you will reduce its need to scratch. You can choose from a variety of types, with simple mechanisms that use a spring, a ball, a stick or a rope. The important thing is that the toy is suitable for your cat's size, age and character. To make the activity even more interesting, you can hide food treats or change the toy often.
