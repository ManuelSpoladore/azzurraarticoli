Finishes for bathroom furnishings: which ones to choose?


Colours and materials can completely change the look of a bathroom, even when the furniture chosen is exactly the same. That's why architects and interior designers know how important it is to choose the right colours and materials for the context.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people rely on colour harmony, others seek a total look by considering the entire home, and others are able to tap into even the most hidden desires of those who are about to design a new home but do not yet have a clear idea of what they want.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The possible requests are truly numerous and unexpected, with new needs, changes of mind or even clients always around the corner. For these reasons, it is therefore advisable to choose a bathroom furnishing partner that guarantees a wide range of finishes and materials, such as the options offered by Azzurra.

<h3>Unicolor HPL</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This durable multi-layer laminate</span><b>&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be chosen for the construction of structures, fronts, living room elements, tops and tops with integrated sinks, as well as for infill panels and groove cladding. It is called </span><b><i>Unicolor</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because </span><b>all the layers are made in the same colour</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> visible on the outside, thus obtaining a material that is even more robust than classic laminate.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Azzurra catalogue offers <strong>11</strong></span><b>&nbsp;different finishes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to achieve an effect similar to wood, marble or mortar.

<h3>Fenix</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an alternative to Unicolor HPL, adding an additional surface layer with a matt effect results in the attractive and highly sought-after Fenix surface. This stands out because it is extremely </span><b>opaque</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with a</span><b> soft-touch</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effect. As well as being aesthetically appealing, it is also functional because it is anti-fingerprint and easy to repair.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here too, there are</span><b> 9 shades</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offered by Azzurra, each one more refined than the last.
