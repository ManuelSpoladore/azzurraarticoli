How to choose materials for the laundry area




<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To design a <strong>laundry area</strong> that is both aesthetically pleasing, functional, and durable, it is necessary to pay close attention to the <strong>choice of materials for the furnishings</strong>, which must be <strong>resistant, water-repellent</strong>, and in harmony with the <strong>design</strong> of the rest of the home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have put together some useful tips to help you choose.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why materials are a choice that should not be underestimated</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The laundry area is the room where furniture is most subject to wear and tear due to the use of water, detergents, steam, and heat. In addition, it is often a small space where many objects accumulate, making accidental knocks and bumps likely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In such a busy place, it is therefore necessary to optimise space and choose the materials for the furnishings with care. These must be:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
  <li><strong>Resistant</strong> to wear and tear, stains, temperature and humidity changes, without deteriorating or deforming over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Practical</strong>, easy to clean and maintain, without requiring special treatments or specific products.</li>
  <li><strong>Aesthetically appealing</strong> to furnish with taste and personality, creating a welcoming and pleasant atmosphere to live in.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Azzurra solutions for the laundry area</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Azzurra's solutions for the laundry area include a wide range of materials to choose from, all of which are durable and high quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To give just a few examples, one of the most suitable materials for the laundry area is the 6 cm thick Dekorativo 3D top covered with 1 mm thick laminate. This combines the resistance of laminate with the aesthetics of Dekorativo 3D, creating a striking textured effect that is designed to last over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This solution is waterproof, scratch-resistant, stain-resistant, and heat-resistant, ensuring long life and easy cleaning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The right choice of materials is also very important for the lower parts of the furniture, as the laundry room floor can often be splashed with water or particularly damp. Azzurra pays great attention to this aspect, offering several options:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
  <li><strong>The open Lime Wash structures have waterproof Tecnoril feet.</strong> This is a composite material, made of acrylic resin and natural minerals, which has excellent resistance to water, chemicals, and UV rays. Feet of this type allow the structure to be raised off the floor, preventing contact with the floor and making cleaning easier.</li>
  <li><strong>Floor-standing furniture is equipped with a 3 cm high aluminium plinth or optional wheels.</strong> Aluminium is a lightweight, sturdy, and rustproof material that protects the furniture from moisture and impact. The wheels are a practical and functional option, allowing the furniture to be moved easily and adapted to different needs. In both cases, the base is raised above the floor.</li>
</ul>
